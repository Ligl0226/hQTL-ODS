# hQTL-ODS
Powerful one-dimensional scan to detect heterotic QTL

The method features:
- The heterotic effects were modeled unbiasedly according to the original definition, i.e., the dominance effect of a locus and its epistatic interaction effect with all other loci were considered, independent of their effect sizes. [http://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3974]
- Fast and powerful implementation of the one-dimensional scan to detect heterotic QTL
- Scanning the individual heterotic effect component of the detected hQTL
- Not only for mid-parent heterosis (MPH) but also for better-parent heterosis (BPH)
- Also, support for analyses of the combination of different effects, i.e., additive + cumulative additive-by-additive effect of a locus, et al.
